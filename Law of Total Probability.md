# Law of Total Probability
### **1. Evaluate the input information**:

The provided information pertains to the **Law of Total Probability**. The formula given is:
$$[ P(A) = P(A|B_1) P(B_1) + \dots + P(A|B_n) P(B_n) ]$$


This formula is indeed correct. The Law of Total Probability is a fundamental concept in probability theory that relates marginal probabilities to conditional probabilities. It provides a way to get the overall probability of an event \(A\) by considering all the ways that \(A\) can happen, based on a partition given by $$(B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n)$$.

The explanation provided is also accurate. It correctly states that this law is useful for partitioning events and can be thought of as a weighted sum of conditional probabilities based on each possible scenario having occurred. The example of a customer making a purchase based on the segment they belong to is a practical application of this concept.

### **2. Extract insights from the input information**:

#### **Real-world Application Scenario**:
Imagine a retail store that has three distinct customer segments: 
1. Regular customers
2. Occasional customers
3. First-time visitors

The store wants to determine the overall probability that a randomly selected customer will make a purchase. They have the following data:
- Probability a customer is a regular: $$( P(B_1) = 0.5 )$$
- Probability a customer is occasional: $$( P(B_2) = 0.3 )$$
- Probability a customer is a first-time visitor: $$( P(B_3) = 0.2 )$$

They also know:
- Probability a regular customer makes a purchase: $$( P(A|B_1) = 0.9 )$$
- Probability an occasional customer makes a purchase: $$( P(A|B_2) = 0.6 )$$
- Probability a first-time visitor makes a purchase: $$( P(A|B_3) = 0.3 )$$

Using the Law of Total Probability, the store can determine the overall probability that a randomly selected customer will make a purchase.

### **3. Implement the application case in code**:

```python
# Given probabilities
P_B1 = 0.5  # Regular customers
P_B2 = 0.3  # Occasional customers
P_B3 = 0.2  # First-time visitors

P_A_given_B1 = 0.9  # Regular customers making a purchase
P_A_given_B2 = 0.6  # Occasional customers making a purchase
P_A_given_B3 = 0.3  # First-time visitors making a purchase

# Calculating the overall probability using the Law of Total Probability
P_A = P_A_given_B1 * P_B1 + P_A_given_B2 * P_B2 + P_A_given_B3 * P_B3

print(f"The overall probability that a randomly selected customer will make a purchase is:\n
= P_A_given_B1 * P_B1 + P_A_given_B2 * P_B2 + P_A_given_B3 * P_B3\n
= {P_A:.2f}")
```
The overall probability that a randomly selected customer will make a purchase is:
= 0.5 * 0.9 + 0.3 * 0.6 + 0.2 * 0.3
= 0.69 

This code calculates the overall probability that a customer will make a purchase based on the given probabilities for each customer segment.
